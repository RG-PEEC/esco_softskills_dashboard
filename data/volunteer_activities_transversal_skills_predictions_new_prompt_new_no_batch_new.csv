About PANDEMIC PROFESSORS, INC. Location: 512 W 156th St., Apt 22, New York City, NY 10032, US Mission Statement: The mission of Pandemic Professors is to facilitate free tutoring to children in low-income communities impacted by the pandemic. Description: At Pandemic Professors (Pan Prof), we believe all K-12 students deserve an opportunity to receive free supplemental learning through private tutoring, in order to help them remain on track and meet their educational goals. Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors. Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices. Together with our partners, Pan Prof combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring. Pan Prof provides effective tools for students to complete their K-12 education until the educational gap is resolved. We sincerely hope you consider joining us to improve the lives of students adversely affected by poverty and the pandemic.","['accept criticism and guidance', 'adapt to change', 'advise others', 'apply knowledge of science, technology and engineering', 'apply knowledge of social sciences and humanities', 'attend to detail', 'carry out calculations', 'create digital content', 'demonstrate intercultural competence', 'demonstrate willingness to learn', 'ensure customer orientation', 'instruct others', 'keep an open mind', 'list of languages', 'manage quality', 'motivate others', 'operate digital hardware', 'organise information, objects and resources', 'plan', 'show commitment', 'show empathy', 'use communication and collaboration software', 'work in teams', 'work independently']","['advise others', 'meet commitments', 'assume responsibility', 'show determination', 'show commitment', 'manage quality', 'adapt to change', 'apply knowledge of science, technology and engineering', 'work in teams', 'instruct others', 'operate digital hardware', 'organise information, objects and resources', 'show empathy', 'work efficiently', 'use equipment, tools or technology with precision', 'maintain concentration for long periods', 'solve problems', 'use communication and collaboration software', 'comply with regulations', 'demonstrate trustworthiness', 'build networks', 'work independently', 'make decisions', 'manage time', 'apply knowledge of social sciences and humanities', 'motivate others', 'respect confidentiality obligations']","[{'skill': 'show initiative', 'needed': False, 'optional': True, 'trainable': True, 'reason': 'The role does not explicitly require volunteers to take the first step without waiting, but being proactive and initiating contact or engagement with students and families would make tutoring more effective and responsive.

"Looking for volunteers for the 2025-2026 school year. To learn more and apply, visit: http://www.mindsmatterbay.org/join/ ABOUT OUR PROGRAM Minds Matter Bay Area is a 100% volunteer-run, educational non-profit that provides low-income students access to strong mentors, instructors and leaders, who help broaden their worldview and prepare them for college and beyond. Students join us as Sophomores, where they build up their academic foundations in math, science, reading, writing and critical thinking, and learn key life skills, like leadership and public speaking. As Juniors, our students focus on improving standardized test scores, managing stress and exploring colleges. During the summers after their sophomore and junior years, we encourage and support our students with finding summer programs at different colleges around the country to push them out of their comfort zones and ready them for college. Finally, as Seniors, our students focus heavily on showcasing their best selves in their college applications and learning more key skills that will ensure that they don’t just graduate from college, but that they thrive during their experience. We also support them with learning about both traditional and creative ways of paying for college, so that finances don't become a barrier to considering a great school. We’re looking for volunteers to help us with every part of this program from tutoring to mentoring to managing programs. At the heart of our organization are people committed to making an impact in education and these students’ lives. At Minds Matter Bay Area, our mentees come first, but our strong community comes in at a close second. Many of our volunteers form lasting friendships and embark on new endeavors together. Whether we’re discussing the latest trends in education over dinner or picnicking in Golden Gate Park, our community knows how to get things done and have fun while doing it. We invite you to join our community and our cause. VOLUNTEER COMMITMENT The opportunity to make an impact on a student’s life comes with important responsibilities. When working with youth, one of the key components to building trust is just showing up. Commitment is key with our program-your presence, proactive communication, and conscientiousness are what makes Minds Matter Bay Area work. Sessions take place from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM every Saturday during the school year (August through May, with breaks following standard school holidays) For Sophomores and Juniors, instructional programs take place from 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM and mentoring from 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM For Seniors, college application prep takes place from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM We require a minimum attendance of 80% of Saturday sessions (approx. 20 of 25 weeks from August through May) and advanced notice of planned absences Building strong relationships with a student is vital for their success and growth, so we strongly prefer a three-year commitment, though we require a minimum of one year INSTRUCTORS The instructional component of our programs is designed to equip students with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary for achieving academic success at school and in their standardized tests. Our instructors serve as guides and role models for our students, encouraging them to deepen their knowledge base and to enjoy the process of learning. Instructors take on a variety of different roles in our organization: leading a class on a subject area, teaching the SAT/ACT, and developing and delivering workshops on close reading, critical thinking, and statement writing skills for our students and their mentors.
